<h1>Tim's Top Flix</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of 2023</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Super Mario Bros</h3>
<p>A great option that is fun for families. A delight to children and nostalgia trip for parents.</p>
<h3>John Wick: Chapter 4</h3>
<p>A heart pounding action movie to the nth degree!</p>
<h3>The Pale Blue Eye</h3>
<p>Christian Bale does it again portraying an emotionally 
    wounded detective commissioned by West Point to solve a 
    murder of one of thier students. An emotional story that keeps you 
    guessing to the very end and is aided by Bales' protoge, Edgar Allen Poe.</p>
